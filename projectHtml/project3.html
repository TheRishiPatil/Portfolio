                <p class="desc hidden">Introducing our innovative Smart Mirror, a unique fusion of information and home
                    security. Powered by a Raspberry Pi 3 B+, camera, PIR sensor, and a screen. The smart mirror
                    operates in two modes: Normal mode and Triggered mode. In Normal mode, it displays real-time
                    information, while Triggered mode transforms it into a vigilant security system. With motion
                    detection, it sends intrusion alerts along with visible video footage to the owner's mobile device,
                    offering both convenience and peace of mind. This Smart Mirror project redefines mirrors, making
                    them an integral part of home security.</p>

            <p class="desc small-screen-desc hidden">This system combines facial recognition access with hidden security features within a smart
                mirror-cupboard combo. Authorized users gain access through facial recognition, while any unauthorized
                attempts activate a concealed PIR sensor and camera. The Raspberry Pi records break-in events, sending
                alerts to the owner via Push-bullet, including video evidence for potential security threats, making it
                a discreet yet powerful security solution.<br>
                The system has 2 modes:<br>
                Normal mode & Triggered mode.

        <div class="mid">
            <p class="desc small-screen-desc hidden">During Normal mode, the mirror serves as a hub for displaying crucial information like the
                date, time, temperature, weather updates, and breaking news. This feature is especially useful for busy
                individuals who may not have the time to keep up with current events on their own, saving them valuable
                time. Along with the information display, the mirror also serves face detection feature in this mode. It
                detects the faces of the people continuosly and sends the notification to the owner via Gmail if it
                detects faces other than the registered users. <br> <br>
                The smart mirror functions as a regular mirror for grooming purposes, but also displays real-time
                information on the screen at the same time. This allows the user to simultaneously perform their morning
                routine while staying up-to-date with important information. </p>

            <p class="desc small-screen-desc hidden">During Triggered mode, the system acts as a security system. In triggered mode the system
                detects intrusion activity and sends alerts to the owner's mobile device, can help provide peace of mind
                and deter potential thieves. This can be especially important for people who live in areas with high
                crime rates or who have experienced theft or other security incidents in the past. During this mode, The
                display is turned off and it behaves as normal mirror while the raspberry pi functions at the background
                hence using the face detection feature. The system continuously monitors the faces and sends the
                notification to the user via gmail if it detects any unknown faces other than registered users. <br>
                <br>
                Further we have added an extra security layer in the form of PIR sensor.The PIR sensor is designed to
                detect any
                motion in front of it. This PIR sensor is fitted inside the cupboard. So if the thief accidentally
                breaches the face detection feature and opens the cupboard to access the locker , then the PIR sensor
                fitted inside detects the motion and the system sends an alert message to the owner's mobile device.
                Additionally, the system captures a clear video of the intruder and delivers it to the owner's mobile
                device.
