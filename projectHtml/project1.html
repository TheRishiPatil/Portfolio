                <p class="desc hidden">Introducing a user-friendly website that simplifies online shopping! This platform
                    enables you to effortlessly compare product prices and specifications from popular e-commerce sites
                    like Flipkart, Amazon, Croma, and Jiomart. I've simplified the process to save you time and effort
                    as you look for the best deals and product quality. With a month of dedicated work, I've created a
                    comprehensive solution, starting with the structuring and design the UI of the webpages and
                    continuing through the scraping data and coding of the backend and frontend. <br>

                <br>
                <br>
                Within the filter list, users can refine their search results by specifying price range, the platform
                from which they prefer to make the purchase, and even select their preferred brand from a list of
                available products. This feature empowers users to tailor their search results to match their specific
                preferences, making the online shopping experience more personalized and efficient.
